# py-thesaurus-interface
An interface to metadata conventions for geospatial data

# Install
```
pip install https://github.com/nansencenter/py-thesaurus-interface/archive/master.tar.gz
```

# Standards

The package follows the standards defined at NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) (http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov) and the NetCDF-CF conventions (http://cfconventions.org/), plus possibly others that will be added as needs emerge... The standards are mapped in Python dictionaries and saved to json-files.

## Directory Interchange Format (DIF) 

The DIF format is a descriptive and standardized format for exchanging information about scientific data sets. The py-thesaurus-interface package provides an interface to the keywords and formats defined at GCMD.

See: Directory Interchange Format (DIF) Writer's Guide, 2015. Global Change Master Directory. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. [http://gcmd.nasa.gov/add/difguide/].
